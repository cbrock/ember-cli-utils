# ember-cli-utils
A small set of utilities to help make working with ember-cli a little easier

## Usage
* `ember-cli -g X.X.X` where `X.X.X` is a valid ember-cli version you'd like to update to, globally. This is the equivalent of doing the following steps in succession:
 * `npm cache clean`
 * `bower cache clean`
 * `npm uninstall -g ember-cli`
 * `npm install -g ember-cli@X.X.X`
